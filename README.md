# wmail-user-scripts
WMail provides ways to customise Gmail and Google Inbox through user scripts. These are snippets of JavaScript and Stylesheets which are able to customise the way your mailboxes work. For example if you like everything red you can easily write a script for that!

## Installing
To install or write you own user scripts follow these instructions

1. Open the `Settings` in WMail
2. Click on the `Accounts` tab
3. Select that account you want to customise
4. Click on `Custom CSS` or `Custom JavaScript` to open a modal
5. Paste or type your userscript into the text field and press `Save` when done

Your mailbox will reload and your script will be applied.

## Userscripts

Here are some userscripts that have been provided by the community to help you customise your mailboxes

* **@axllent [Hide Ads in Gmail](axllent/hideads/userscript.css)** - hides the ads in Gmail and make the email screen wider [CSS](axllent/hideads/userscript.css)
